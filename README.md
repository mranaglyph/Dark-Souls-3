Scripts for all the Souls Games [That I Can Make]

Challenge Run Generator : .py and .exe available.
The Challenge Run Generator is specifically designed for DS3. 
All you need to do is run the generator, and it will give you a list of challenges for you to complete.
You don't need to do all of them at once, but it is designed to allow you to, should you want that difficulty.
Some of the challenges might not be possible from the beginning of the game, unless you have CE or mods. 
However, you can obviously choose to avoid the parts that are impossible until you aquire the appropriate weapons/armor, etc.

Force Challenge : .py and .exe available.
The Force Challenge app is designed for DSR, and only works in DSR (AFAIK).
Simply follow the instructions in the window, by entering the information requested. 
It does give you 10 seconds after you have selected your options to change the active window back to DSR.
Works on Windows and with fullscreen or windowed DSR.
